# Battle Cats Hacking Scripts

A collection of Frida hacking scripts for The Battle Cats made in python - root required

I have a discord server: https://discord.gg/DvmMgvn5ZB, it's the best way report bugs and you can leave your suggestions for new features to be implemented in the tool

If you want to support my work and keep me motivated to 
continue to work on projects like this then maybe consider gifting me some 
ko-fi here: https://ko-fi.com/fieryhenry

## How To Use

1. Follow the guide on the frida website to get your frida-server running on your device: https://frida.re/docs/android/

2. Clone the repository: https://github.com/fieryhenry/Battle-Cats-Hacking-Scripts/archive/refs/heads/master.zip

3. Have the frida-server running on your device
   
   The following steps are done on your pc, not android device:

4. cd into the scripts directory in a terminal / shift+right click -> powershell window here

5. Use python to run the desired script - some scripts may only work with an x86 system architecture as that's the one I have reverse engineered the most

6. Enter your game version and do what you want

7. If any item amounts or stats are modified you will need to go into another menu in game for it to save your changes - e.g the equip menu, upgrade menu, etc
